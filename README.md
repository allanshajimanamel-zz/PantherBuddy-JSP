# PantherBuddy-JSP
Advanced Software Engineering Project (Fall 2016) project

This is the project created for my Advanced Software Engineering Project (Fall 2016).

PantherBuddy is a forum for collection of information on life and studies at Florida International University.

The project was built using Java and JSP. The backend database was implemented in MySQL.

We used JUnit and Mockito for our testing. We did the unit test, subsystem test and the system test for the project.

We used "Bootstrap" to make the application mobile device compatible.

The project "PantherBuddyUML" contains the UML diagrams created during the requirements and design phase. It was done using the "Papyrus" plugin for eclipse.
The code was generated from the class diagram and then worked upon.
