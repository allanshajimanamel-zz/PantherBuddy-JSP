# PantherBuddy-JSP
Advanced Software Engineering Project (Fall 2016) project

This is the project created for my Advanced Software Engineering Project (Fall 2016).

PantherBuddy is a forum for collection of information on life and studies at Florida International University.

The project was built using Java and JSP. The backend database was implemented in MySQL.
